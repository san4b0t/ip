I see you are trying to add an event.
it seems you did not use the '/from' and '/to' flags properly
input in the following format:
event <task> /from <start> /to <end>
I see you are trying to add a task with a deadline.
it seems you did not use the '/by' flag properly
input in the following format:
deadline <task> /by <deadline>
